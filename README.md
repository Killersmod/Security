# Security
A place to store my notes on all things Tech

Goals: Strip ALL fluff. Clear Concise Natural "security dictionary". Easy and Medium topics.

Who is this for: Begginers or people wanting to relearn foundations.

Who is this not for: These notes will not help programmers, except in securing their code. I do not cover code optimization, refactoring, runtimes, etc except in the context of security.

Where to start: All topics can be found in Fundamentals | Terminology. All information in Terminology is structerd as such, "Folder | File _ Keyword in file". Multiple folders will be labeld as "Folder | Folder | File _ Keyword in file". Example, the starting point Fundamentals | Terminology _ CTF can be found from the starting folder, clicking into Fundamentals, opening the Terminology file, then searching the keyword CTF.

Note 1:
Firewall, IDS, IPS, and WAF are all encompassed into the NGFW category.

Note 2:
Fundamentals | Security Analyst contains information stored in other areas, not all unique information. This breaks the rule of strip all fluff as its all reduntant information. But I currently think its important to put here to quick refrence certain material.

Note 3:
Detection Steps and Remdiation steps SHOULD NOT be completed until spoken with your team. Cyber Security is hard because almost everything is a act of balancing. 
Example: Detection: SSH IOC > Remeditation: Block SSH > Result: Your managment team on a business trip no longer has outside access to SSH > Consequence: Chaos
